"""
    Electrical discharge machining (EDM) utilizes a thermoelectric process called 'spark erosion'. Sparks erosion removes material 
    by vaporizing/boiling away metal using many very small electric sparks. Sparks happen very quickly, lasting only for a
    fraction of a millisecond.

    The Rack Robotics's Powercore is a transistor EDM power supply unit. The Powercore creates, maintains, and monitors electrical 
    sparks in an EDM machine. It is designed to be affordable and hackable. The Powercore has several features to achive its purpose: 

    On-Board Raspberry Pi Pico  -   A drop-in Raspberry Pi Pico module is used as an on-board microcontroller, allowing for maximum flexibility. 
                                    Micropython come pre-flashed on-board. Do not attempt to program microcontroller while machining, or while 
                                    powered on.
    
    Transistor Control          -   A high-voltage & high-current power MOSFET (IRF135S203) controls when sparks can form. The MOSFET is
                                    primarily controlled via PWM. The logic of the high-voltage MOSFET is inverted. Meaning that when the 
                                    MOSFET pin state is low, current can pass. When the MOSFET pin state is high, current can not pass. 
                                    This is because of the low-voltage AOD508 MOSFET used to drive the high-voltage MOSFET.

    Adjustable Frequency        -   The minimum frequency between sparks is controlled digitally via PWM. Recommended operating frequency is 2 KHz.
                                    Higher frequencies can generate more waste heat than lower frequencies, potentially damaging the switching MOSFET.

    Adjustable Duty cycle       -   The maximum duration of sparks is controlled digitally via PWM.

    Current Monitoring          -   Current is monitored via an analog sensor (ACS712_x20A) within a range of +-20 amps. During capacitor dscharge, this maxes out 
                                    the current sensor, causing a peak that resembles a digital peak. 

    Thermal Monitoring          -   An onboard thermister monitors the temperature of the power resistor and MOSFET, helping to preventing overheating.

    Short Circuit Alert         -   (Work in Progress!) Digital feedback is provided during the event of a short by the "short alert" port (3.3 v normal, 0 v during short).

    Analog Feedback             -   Analog feedback from the ACS712x20A current sensor is provided by the "current" port (1.667 v - 0.333 v)
                                    This system adjusts the reported voltage with a sensitivity of ~0.0667 volts / amp. The baseline voltage 
                                    of the system is the voltage reported when no current is flowing through the system. The voltage is approximately 
                                    ~1.667 v volts. When current increases, the voltage reported will decrease at a rate of 
                                    ~0.667 volts per amp. A reading of 0.333 volts indicates >= 20 amps. During capacitor dscharge, this maxes out 
                                    the current sensor, causing a peak that resembles a digital peak.

"""
The Powercore V1 EDM power supply contains a power resistor. The temperature of the power resistor can be monitored as an added safety feature. In the event 
that power resistor temperature rises to unsafe levels, then action can be taken by the microcontroller. If the temperature is extremely low, this indicates 
an electrical failure, such as the thermister not being connected securely. The same is done for the power MOSFET.

A thermister is a variable resistor. Microcontrollers can not read resistance, only voltages, with an analog to voltage converter. This is done with a voltage 
divider, containing the thermister and a 10K pullup resistor. Converting the observed voltage to a temperature requires a beta coefficient, a specification for thermisters.
